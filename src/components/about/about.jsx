                <p>TED is on a mission to discover and spread ideas that spark imagination, embrace possibility 
                  and catalyze impact. Our organization is devoted to curiosity, reason, wonder and the pursuit 
                  of knowledge â€” without an agenda. We welcome people from every discipline and culture who seek 
                  a deeper understanding of the world and connection with others, and we invite everyone to engage 
                  with ideas and activate them in your community. TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, 
                  Entertainment and Design converged, but today it spans a multitude of worldwide communities and 
                  initiatives exploring everything from science and business to education, arts and global issues. 
                  TED is owned by a nonprofit, nonpartisan foundation. Our aim is to help create a future worth pursuing for all.</p>
